Growth
======

The objective of this project is to produce an environment in which simulated entities will randomly mutate according to a sort of genetic algorith, and compete for resources, to result in a natural emerge of unique non-trivial, non-obvious forms of entities.

The program is entirely text-based as for now.

Usage
-----

* `make`
* `./main [# of generations (100-10,000)]`

Note: `./generateData [# of generations (100-10,000)]` can be exectued to pipe data from main concerning average plant statistics into a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet. The data can easy be then graphed and visualized using the chart button.
